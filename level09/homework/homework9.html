  <h3>favorite sport</h3>
  <p>Wrestling at the Olympic Games first appeared at the first modern Olympics, in the form of Greco-Roman wrestling,
    held in Athens in 1896. Wrestling would appear at every Summer Olympics held since then, with the exception of the
    1900 Summer Olympics when wrestling did not appear on the program. Freestyle wrestling (or, catch-as-catch-can
    wrestling as it was called prior to the 1948 Olympics) and weight classes both made their first appearance at the
    1904 Summer Olympics. Women's freestyle wrestling competition was first held at the 2004 Summer Olympics.
    In 2013, the IOC voted to drop wrestling from the Summer Olympic program. The president of the sport's governing
    body, FILA (now United World Wrestling), resigned after a subsequent motion of no confidence, and several of the
    FILA leadership followed suit. Following these and revisions to the program for 2016 (including rule changes and
    additional women's competitions), wrestling successfully campaigned to be readmitted back onto the Summer Olympic
    program.</p>
